      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">What is a cookie?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
        when you visit. It typically contains information about the website
        itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
        browser when you return, additional data that serves the cookie’s
        purpose, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies are used to enable certain features (e.g. logging in), track
        site usage (e.g. analytics), store your user settings (e.g. time zone,
        notification preferences), and to personalize your content (e.g.
        advertising, language).
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies set by the website you are visiting are usually referred to as
        first-party cookies. They typically only track your activity on that
        particular site.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cookies set by other sites and companies (i.e. third parties) are called
        third-party cookies. They can be used to track you on other websites
        that use the same third-party service.
      </p>

        Types of cookies and how we use them
      </h3>
      <p className="mb-4">Functionality cookies</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Functionality cookies are used to collect information about your device
        and any settings you may configure on the website you’re visiting (like
        language and time zone settings). With this information, websites can
        provide you with customized, enhanced, or optimized content and
        services. These cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting
        (first-party) or by third-party services.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We use functionality cookies for selected features on our site.

      <p className="mb-4">Targeting/advertising cookies</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Targeting/advertising cookies help determine what promotional content is
        most relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may
        use them to deliver targeted advertising or limit the number of times
        you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness
        of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These
        cookies may be set by the website you’re visiting (first-party) or by
        third-party services.

      <p className="mb-4">We use targeting/advertising cookies on our site.</p>
