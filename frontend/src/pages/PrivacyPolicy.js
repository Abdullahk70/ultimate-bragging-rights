      <p>
        While SPORTS FANS I.Q. CHALLENGES INC. endeavors to keep, store and
        handle customer data within locations in Canada, it may use agents or
        service providers located in the United States (U.S.), European Economic
        Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK) to collect, use, retain and process
        personal information as part of providing services to you. While we use
        all reasonable efforts to ensure that personal information receives the
        same level of security in any other jurisdiction as it would in Canada,
        please be aware that privacy protections under U.S. laws may not be the
        same adequacy.

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Customer Data Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Although PIPEDA does not contain an extensive set of consumer rights, it
        does grant consumers the right to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Access the personal information organizations hold about them;</li>
        <li>
          Correct any inaccurate or outdated personal information the
          organization hold about them (or, if this is not possible, delete the
          inaccurate personal information);
        </li>
        <li>
          Withdraw consent for any activities for which they have consented
          (e.g. direct marketing or cookies).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Right to Withdraw Consent</h2>
      <p>
        Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information
        for a specific purpose. Subject to some restrictions, you can, at any
        time, refuse to consent, or continue to consent to the collection, use
        or disclosure of their personal information by notifying us using the
        email address below in the ‘Contact Us’ section. Withdrawal of consent
        may impact our ability to provide or continue to provide services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Customers cannot refuse collection, use and disclosure of their personal
        information if such information is required to:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>be collected, used or disclosed as required by any law;</li>
        <li>fulfill the terms of any contractual agreement; and</li>
        <li>
          be collected, used or disclosed as required by any regulators
          including self regulatory organizations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While you may request that we delete your contact details at any time,
        we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further
        enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to
        enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this
        privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Right of Access under PIPEDA</h2>
      <p>
        PIPEDA gives you a general right to access the PII held by businesses
        subject to this law. Under PIPEDA, you need to make your access request
        in writing and pay a minimal fee of $30.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        If any organizational fees seem unjust, you have the right to complain
        about this. We retain the right to decide how we disclose the copies of
        your PII to you. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill your
        request in 30 days from receipt, otherwise we must inform you of our
        inability to do so before the 30-day timeframe if:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>
          meeting the time limit would unreasonably interfere with our business
          activities; or
        </li>
        <li>
          the time required to undertake consultations necessary to respond to
          the request would make it impractical to meet the time limit.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We can also extend the time limit for the length of time required to
        convert the personal information into an alternative format. In these
        circumstances, we will advise you of the delay within the first 30 days
        and explain the reason for it.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-4">
        Right of rectification under PIPEDA
      </h2>
      <p>
        You may request a correction to any factual errors or omissions within
        your PII. We would ask you to provide some evidence to back up your
        claim. Under PIPEDA, an organization must amend the information, as
        required, if you successfully demonstrate that it’s incomplete or
        inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may contact us at any time, using the information provided in the
        Contact Us section of this privacy policy if you believe your PII on our
        systems is incorrect or incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot agree on changing the information, you have the right to
        have your concerns recorded with the Office of the Privacy Commission of
        Canada.
