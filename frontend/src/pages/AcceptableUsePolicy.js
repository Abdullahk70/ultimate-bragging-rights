      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Fair use</h3>
      <p>
        We provide our facilities with the assumption your use will be "business
        as usual", as per our offer schedule. If your use is considered to be
        excessive, then additional fees may be charged or capacity may be
        restricted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are opposed to all forms of abuse, discrimination, rights
        infringement and/or any action that harms or disadvantages any group,
        individual or resource. We expect our customers and, where applicable,
        their users ("end-users") to likewise engage our Products with similar
        intent.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Customer accountability</h3>
      <p>
        We regard our customers as being responsible for their own actions as
        well as for the actions of anyone using our Products with the customer’s
        permission. This responsibility also applies to anyone using our
        Products on an unauthorized basis as a result of the customer’s failure
        to put in place reasonable security measures.
      </p>
      <p>
        By accepting Products from us, our customers agree to ensure adherence
        to this policy on behalf of anyone using the Products as their end
        users. Complaints regarding the actions of customers or their end-users
        will be forwarded to the nominated contact for the account in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a customer — or their end-user or anyone using our Products as a
        result of the customer — violates our acceptable use policy, we reserve
        the right to terminate any Products associated with the offending
        account or the account itself or take any remedial or preventative
        action we deem appropriate without notice. To the extent permitted by
        law, no credit will be available for interruptions of service resulting
        from any violation of our acceptable use policy.
